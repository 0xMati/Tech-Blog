## 🚀 What is Commando VM?

**Commando VM** is a fully customizable Windows-based penetration testing virtual machine, developed by **FireEye's Mandiant Red Team**.  
It transforms a standard Windows installation into a powerful offensive security platform, loaded with tools for **red teaming, post-exploitation, and adversary emulation**.

> 💡 Unlike Kali Linux or Parrot OS which are Linux-based, Commando VM is designed **exclusively for Windows** users or those targeting Windows environments.

### ⚙️ Automated Installation via Chocolatey  
- Deploys **hundreds of tools** using Chocolatey (Windows package manager).
- Example tools:
  - **BloodHound** – Active Directory enumeration.
  - **Mimikatz** – Credential dumping.
  - **SharpTools / PowerView / Seatbelt** – Red team essentials.
  - **Sysinternals**, **Wireshark**, **Burp Suite**, and more.

### 🔐 Active Directory Reconnaissance & Exploitation  
- Comes with tools to map AD trusts, find privilege escalation paths, and simulate lateral movement.

### 📜 PowerShell & C# Arsenal  
- Fully integrated PowerShell attack frameworks (e.g., PowerSploit).
- Supports custom .NET payloads with preloaded C# tools.

### 📦 Modular & Extensible  
- You can enable/disable tool categories: web, cloud, forensics, exploitation, etc.
