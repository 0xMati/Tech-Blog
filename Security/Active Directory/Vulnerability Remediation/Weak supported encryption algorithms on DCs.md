## üîê Introduction ‚Äì Kerberos Encryption Algorithms on Domain Controllers

In Active Directory environments, Kerberos authentication is the default and most secure protocol used for identity verification. When a user or service authenticates, Kerberos tickets are issued by the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which is implemented on Domain Controllers (DCs).

Each Kerberos ticket is encrypted using one or more supported algorithms. These encryption types determine how credentials and session keys are protected in transit. Over time, encryption standards have evolved ‚Äî from DES (Data Encryption Standard) and RC4 to AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

The following encryption types are commonly found on Windows DCs:

| Encryption Type           | Hex Value       | Status                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| DES-CBC-CRC / DES-CBC-MD5 | `0x1` / `0x2`   | Deprecated & insecure ‚ùå       |
| RC4-HMAC                  | `0x4`           | Weak (legacy support) ‚ö†Ô∏è      |
| AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96   | `0x8`           | Strong ‚úÖ                      |
| AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96   | `0x10`          | Strong ‚úÖ                      |
| AES\*-HMAC-SHA2 (256/384) | `0x11` / `0x12` | Very strong (newer systems) ‚úÖ |
| Future encryption types   | `0x20`          | Reserved for future use       |

While older encryption types (DES, RC4) were once used for compatibility with legacy systems, they are now considered cryptographically broken or weak. Microsoft recommends disabling DES and RC4, and ensuring DCs support and issue only AES-based tickets.

Auditing the encryption algorithms used and supported on your domain controllers is a critical step in securing your identity infrastructure.

### üìé Understanding msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes

The msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute is a bitmask stored on computer objects in Active Directory. It defines which Kerberos encryption types a computer ‚Äî including Domain Controllers (DCs) ‚Äî is allowed to use for issuing and accepting Kerberos tickets.

When this attribute is not set, the system falls back to default behavior, typically allowing RC4 for backward compatibility.
When explicitly configured, the attribute value is calculated as a sum of hexadecimal flags corresponding to the desired encryption algorithms.

For example:

0x18 = 0x8 (AES128) + 0x10 (AES256) ‚Üí AES only

0x1C = AES128 + AES256 + Future types

0x1F = AES + RC4 + DES ‚Äî ‚ùå insecure, should be avoided

This setting can be manually applied per computer, but for Domain Controllers, Microsoft strongly recommends configuring it via Group Policy, using:

Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options >
‚ÄúNetwork security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos‚Äù

This approach ensures consistent and centralized control over Kerberos encryption policies across your domain.

## üßæ Phase 1 ‚Äì Reporting on Kerberos Encryption Configuration of Domain Controllers

The first step in securing Kerberos encryption across an Active Directory forest is to identify what encryption algorithms are currently enabled on each Domain Controller. This is done by querying the msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute for all DCs across all domains in the forest.

The PowerShell script below performs this task by:

- Iterating over all domains in the forest
- Querying each Domain Controller‚Äôs computer object
- Decoding the bitmask of supported encryption algorithms using a predefined map
- Flagging each DC with a vulnerability level based on known risks:
- Level 2 ‚Üí DES algorithms are enabled (DES-CBC-CRC, DES-CBC-MD5)
- Level 3 ‚Üí AES is not supported (no AES128 or AES256)
- Level 4 ‚Üí RC4 is enabled (RC4-HMAC)
- OK ‚Üí Only AES is enabled

This gives administrators a clear view of which DCs are misconfigured and potentially exposing the environment to cryptographic weaknesses.

Below is the script used to perform this forest-wide assessment:

‚úÖ Prerequisites :

Before running the Kerberos encryption audit script across your forest, make sure the following prerequisites are met:

- PowerShell Environment : Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+
- Run from a domain-joined machine (management server, workstation, or Domain Controller)
- Required Modules : Active Directory PowerShell module
- Permissions : The script must be executed by an account that has read access to all domains and DC computer objects
- Network Requirements : The machine running the script must be able to resolve and connect to all Domain Controllers via: DNS, LDAP / RPC (default ports: 389, 135)
- Firewall rules must allow LDAP/LDAPs queries and remote AD object resolution across domains

## üßæ Phase 2 ‚Äì Analyzing Kerberos Ticket Usage Across Domain Controllers for impact

Now that we know what encryption algorithms are configured on each Domain Controller via the msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute, the next step is to verify what encryption algorithms are actually being used in practice.
Each time a Kerberos ticket is issued‚Äîeither a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) or a Service Ticket (TGS)‚Äîan event is logged in the Security event log of the issuing Domain Controller:

- Event ID 4768 ‚Äì A Kerberos TGT (AS-REQ) was issued
- Event ID 4769 ‚Äì A service ticket (TGS-REQ) was issued

Both events include a field called TicketEncryptionType, which contains a numeric code representing the encryption algorithm used to protect that ticket.
By collecting and analyzing these logs across all DCs, administrators can:

- Identify legacy systems still requesting weak encryption (e.g., DES, RC4)
- Confirm whether only AES-based encryption is used in production
- Pinpoint specific clients or services that would break if legacy encryption is disabled

This practical insight is crucial before enforcing a hardening policy‚Äîespecially in large or heterogeneous environments.


üß± Prerequisites for Kerberos Ticket Analysis

To successfully analyze Kerberos encryption usage via the Security event logs, Kerberos auditing must be enabled on all Domain Controllers.
Make sure the following subcategories are enabled:
- Audit Kerberos Authentication Service (for TGT issuance ‚Äì Event ID 4768)
- Audit Kerberos Service Ticket Operations (for service tickets ‚Äì Event ID 4769)


üìã Kerberos Event ID Reference

| Event ID | Description                        | Purpose                                | Triggered When                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **4768** | Kerberos Authentication Service    | TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) is issued | A user or computer authenticates to the domain  |
| **4769** | Kerberos Service Ticket Operations | TGS (Service Ticket) is issued         | A client accesses a service secured by Kerberos |

Both events include the TicketEncryptionType field, which can be extracted to determine which encryption algorithm was used to secure the ticket (e.g., AES, RC4, DES).
