# 🛠️ Where to Start Security: Lock It Down with Zero Trust and SAF
🗓️ Published: 2025-07-01

## Introduction

Hello, security champions! 🛡️  
Regarding CyberSecurity, there are no easy answers, but we are investing to make it easier for you.

Microsoft invest 1Billion/year in Security, and we are 8500+ security guys to help you at the office from Seattle to Paris.

Before we dive into Zero Trust and the Security Adoption Framework, let’s cover four simple truths:

1. **Security success = attacker failure + increased attacker cost/friction.** 🚨
   - First, block cheap and easy attacks so hackers can’t get in easily.  
   - Next, when something slips through, detect it fast and kick it out, every minute counts.

2. **Attackers have a shopping list.** 💸  
   - You can rent ransomware kits for about **\$66**, phishing as a service for **\$100–\$1,000**, or a DDoS attack for under **\$800 per month**.  
   - Stolen passwords sell for **\$0.97 per 1,000**, so attackers often buy rather than build.  
   - This makes attacks cheap and frequent, our defenses need to keep up.

3. **Threats continuously evolve.** 🔄  
   - Cutting-edge attackers invent new methods, while commoditization spreads those tools to everyone.  
   - Today’s advanced exploit can become tomorrow’s kit on the dark web in hours—or days.  
   - That means we must stay agile, refresh our controls, and lean on Zero Trust to protect data wherever it goes.

4. **Security is everyone’s job.** 🤝  
   - From clicking links to approving maintenance, any decision affects risk.  
   - The security team can’t handle it all alone, developers, ops, HR, finance, and yes, the bosses, must share responsibility and speak the same security language.

→ With these points in mind, this guide will help you **get started**, focus on what really matters, face today’s attacker market, and bring security into every part of your organization. Ready, let’s lock it down!

## 1. The Zero Trust Model

Zero Trust is a cybersecurity approach based on “never trust, always verify.” It continuously authenticates and authorizes every access request regardless of where it originates, using identity, device posture, location, and behavior signals.

1. Verify explicitly 🕵️‍♂️  
   Check every access request, by confirming who you are, what device you use, and where you are.

2. Least privilege 🎁  
   Give only the access you need, ask for more only when you really need it.

3. Assume breach 🚨  
   Act as if attackers are already inside, encrypt your data, log all actions, and isolate threats fast.

4. Micro segmentation 🗂  
   Divide your network and systems into small zones, so a problem in one zone can be contained.

Why it rocks  
* Attackers face one barrier after another, because every request is checked.  
* You spot trouble in minutes, not days, thanks to constant monitoring.  
* Hackers give up fast when they hit too much friction.

→ Zero Trust is not a one-time magic trick, it is a journey: map your most important data and apps, find where you trust by default, then apply these four rules everywhere, to build a security shield that grows with your needs.

## 2. What are Microsoft SAF Offers?

Think of SAF as your security GPS, guiding you through each step with hands-on workshops and clear checklists—plus the Microsoft tools you’ll actually use.

Before diving into SAF modules, Microsoft offers two starter sessions to help you kick things off, and one security check session to see exactly where you stand:

### Overview & Scoping
**Use case:** Getting started, pick the right path based on current needs and priorities  

### Security Capability Adoption Planning (SCAP)
**Use case:** Maximize value from your existing licenses (Microsoft 365 E5, Unified)  

### Enterprise Security Assessment (ESA)  
**Use case:** Deep dive into your current security posture, uncover gaps, and get a customized roadmap for modernization
