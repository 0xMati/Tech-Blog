## Why Profiles Matter
You’ve got Global Secure Access up and running, capturing traffic via clients and remote networks. Next, you need to **decide what traffic** actually gets funneled through SSE. That’s where **Traffic Forwarding Profiles** come in. They let you:

- Pick which apps or destinations to secure (`Microsoft 365`, public internet, private apps).  
- Apply policies like MFA or Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) before access.  
- Tune performance by limiting the tunnel to just the traffic that needs protection.

## Profile Types

| Profile Name        | Purpose                                                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Microsoft`         | Routes only Microsoft 365 services (Outlook, Teams, Graph).   |
| `Internet Access`   | Routes browser & SaaS traffic for web filtering & TLS inspect.|
| `Private Access`    | Routes internal apps (HTTP/S, RDP, SSH, SMB) via ZTNA.        |

## Microsoft Profile

**Objectives**
- Capture only Microsoft 365 service traffic (`Teams`, `Outlook`, `OneDrive`, `Graph API`).  
- Enforce Zero Trust policies specifically for those services.  
- Verify correct routing on both client and remote setups.

**Prerequisites**
- Global Secure Access Administrator permissions.  
- Active Entra Internet Access or Suite license.  
- Test environment: Windows device with Global Secure Access client **or** a configured remote network.  

**Steps**
1. **Open Traffic Profiles**  
   - Navigate to **Global Secure Access > Connect > Traffic fowarding** in the Entra admin center.

2. **Enable Microsoft traffic profile**

3. **Check Microsoft traffic policies** 
   - Clic on Microsoft traffic policies to ensure that you capture traffic for required workloads

   - The policy groups are listed, with a checkbox to indicate if the policy group is enabled. Expand a policy group to view all of the IPs and FQDNs included in the group.

The policy groups include the following details:

   * Destination type: FQDN or IP subnet
   * Destination: The details of the FQDN or IP subnet
   * Ports: TCP or UDP ports that are combined with the IP addresses to form the network endpoint
   * Protocol: TCP or UDP
   * Action: Forward or Bypass

> 💡  You can configure the traffic acquisition rules to bypass traffic acquisition. If you do, the users are still able to access resources, however, the Global Secure Access service doesn't process the traffic.
      Traffic is sent direct instead of being evaluated, for example by a linked Conditional Access policy to GSA.
   

**Validation**
- **Client test**: On a Windows endpoint, browse to `https://outlook.office.com`.  
  - In the tray’s **Advanced Diagnostics**, confirm `Profile=MS365-Profile` and `Decision=Acquired`.
- **Remote test**: On a non-client device behind your branch, run:  
  ```bash
  curl -I https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me
  ```  
  - In **Global Secure Access > Monitor > Traffic logs**, filter by `Profile=MS365-Profile`.

## Internet Access Profile

**Objectives**
- Route and secure general internet and SaaS traffic through SSE.  
- Apply web content filtering, threat intelligence, and TLS inspection.  
- Validate SWG policy enforcement on client and remote setups.

**Prerequisites**
- Global Secure Access Administrator permissions.  
- Azure Key Vault with TLS inspection certificate.  
- Active Entra Internet Access or Suite license.  
- Test environment: Windows device with client or configured remote network.

**Steps**
1. **Open Traffic Profiles**  
   - Go to **Global Secure Access > Traffic profiles**.
2. **Create Profile**  
   - Click **+ New profile** → **Internet Access**.  
   - Name: ``Internet-SWG``.
3. **Web Content Filtering**  
   - Block categories: Social Networking, Streaming Media.  
   - **Allowed FQDNs**: e.g., ``intranet.contoso.com``.
4. **Threat Intelligence**  
   - Enable Microsoft + third‑party feeds.
5. **TLS Inspection**  
   - Reference your Key Vault cert and enable on port 443.
6. **Protocol Controls**  
   - Limit to HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443).
7. **Save & Apply**  
   - Click **Save**.  
   - Under **Connect > Traffic forwarding**, toggle ``Internet-SWG``.  
   - Wait 5–10 minutes.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Use category-based blocking first, then refine with FQDNs to reduce false positives.

**Validation**
- **Client test**: Browse to `http://facebook.com` and confirm the SSE block page.  
- **TLS test**: Access `https://example.com`, then check decrypted logs for SNI details.  
- **Threat Intel test**:  
  ```bash
  curl http://malicious.test
  ```  
  Verify it’s blocked.

## Private Access Profile

**Objectives**
- Secure internal apps (HTTP/S, RDP, SSH, SMB) via micro‑tunnels.  
- Define granular segmentation by FQDN, SPN, IP, and port.  
- Validate Zero Trust access without a full VPN client.

**Prerequisites**
- Global Secure Access Administrator permissions.  
- Deployed Network Connector or remote network.  
- Active Entra Internet Access or Suite license.  
- Internal endpoints (IIS, RDP server, SSH server).

**Steps**
1. **Open Traffic Profiles**  
   - Navigate to **Global Secure Access > Traffic profiles**.
2. **Create Profile**  
   - Click **+ New profile** → **Private Access**.  
   - Name: ``ZTNA-Apps``.
3. **Define Segments**  
   - **AppWeb**: FQDN `intra.contoso.local`, port 443.  
   - **AppRDP**: IP `10.1.1.5`, port 3389.
4. **Protocol Rules**  
   - Enable HTTP/S, RDP, SSH.
5. **Save & Apply**  
   - Click **Save**.  
   - Under **Connect > Traffic forwarding**, toggle ``ZTNA-Apps``.  
   - Wait 5–10 minutes.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Test SSH segment from a Linux box to confirm non-Windows client support.

**Validation**
- **Web test**: Browse `https://intra.contoso.local`.  
- **RDP test**: Connect to `10.1.1.5` via RDP.  
- In logs, filter by `Profile=ZTNA-Apps` and check `Decision=Acquired`.

## Hook Up Conditional Access
Profiles secure traffic; CA policies secure identities. To link them:
1. In **Azure AD > Security > Conditional Access**, click **+ New policy**.
2. Assign **Users/Groups** and **Cloud apps** (`Global Secure Access Connector`).
3. Under **Grant**, require **MFA**, **Compliant device**, and **CAE**.
4. Under **Session**, enable **Continuous Access Evaluation**.
5. Turn on the policy.

> Now, any time a user tries to reach resources via that profile, they’ll pass through your CA gate.

---

## Test & Validate
1. **Client**: Verify profiles appear in the tray’s Health Check after rollout.  
2. **Remote**: From a branch device, test each profile’s scenario.  
3. Check **Monitor > Traffic logs** to confirm profiles and decisions.  

---

## Best Practices
- Start with a pilot group before full deployment.  
- Adopt consistent naming conventions (`Env-Purpose`, e.g., `Prod-Internet`).  
- Review logs regularly to refine filters.  
- Combine with DLP or insider-risk policies for comprehensive security.
