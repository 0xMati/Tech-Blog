## Introduction

Every mailbox in Office 365 have a basic level of protection : Exchange Online Protection (EOP) with :
    - AntiPhishing
    - AntiSpam
    - AntiMalware


Since a lot of attack starts with email, you should have the best protection possible on this part.

Microsoft Defender for Office has 2 plans :

    - MDO for Plan 1
    - MDO for Plan 2


There is two differents configuration options :
    
    - Easy configuration, where you accept Microsoft recommandations
    - Manual configuration, to set all parameters to suit your needs


## Easy Configuration / Preset Security Settings


### Access the Defender Portal

Go to security.microsoft.com, and the "Email & Collaboration" blade:

     - Buit-in protection
     - Standard protection
     - Strict protection

All differences can be found here : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365

You can decide which is the right configuration for you.


Something interesting is that you can choose which kind of people (Users, Groups, Domains) will have applied the built-in, standart or strict policy settings.

For example :

Start with EOP :
