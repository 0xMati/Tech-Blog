# Technical Overview, Sizing, and Architecture
üóìÔ∏è Published: 2025-07-13

Hey ! In this article, we'll dive deep into the guts of Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI): from core concepts to deployment topology, and how to size your sensors like a boss.

## Core Definitions

Before we get tactical, let‚Äôs cover some lingo:

- **Network Activity (NA):** MDI‚Äôs logical representation of raw network packets.  
- **Unique Entity (UE):** A user, computer, or group in your AD.  
- **Entity:** The fusion of an NA and UE‚Äîbasically ‚Äúwho did what‚Äù in your environment.

## How MDI Works Under the Hood

MDI‚Äôs lifecycle has four phases:

1. **Analyze:**  
   - When installed **on domain controllers**, sensors see your traffic in real time with no port mirroring or extra servers needed.  
   - For **standalone network sensors**, you do need a network TAP or port-mirroring configured to feed the sensor with traffic.  
   - You can configure proxy settings during install or post-install via registry.

2. **Learn:**  
   - Immediately after installation, MDI starts profiling normal behavior for users, devices, and resources.  
   - It continuously updates as your environment evolves.

3. **Detect:**  
   - MDI flags abnormal behavior only when contextually aggregated (so fewer false positives).  
   - It leverages Microsoft‚Äôs TTP-based research to spot both known and novel threats in near real time.

4. **Alert:**  
   - All suspicious activities surface in a clear, actionable attack timeline.  
   - Every alert answers ‚ÄúWho? What? When? How?‚Äù and comes with investigation and remediation tips.

## Architecture & Deployment Topology

Let‚Äôs map out where the sensors and services live:

- **MDI Sensors:**  
  - Deployed on your **Domain Controllers** (including RODCs), **Entra ID Connect** and **AD FS** servers.  
  - Each sensor analyzes all local traffic, resolves network entities, and applies dynamic resource limits so you don‚Äôt crush your DC‚Äôs CPU/RAM.  
- **Sensor-to-Cloud Communication:**  
  - Sensors use HTTPS (TLS 1.2) to send only metadata to the MDI Cloud Service.  
  - Stable connectivity is key‚Äîsensor caching is brief by design.  
  - If your DCs can‚Äôt hit the internet directly, proxy config is supported.  
- **MDI Cloud Service:**  
  - Hosted in Azure, tapping into the Intelligent Security Graph for threat intel and ML.  
- **Microsoft Defender Portal:**  
  - Your cockpit for alert triage, investigation timelines, configuring workspaces, and exporting alerts to SIEM or Sentinel.

## Sizing Your Deployment

Sizing right keeps your MDI sensors healthy:

- **MDI Sizing Tool:**  
  - Run the tool (https://aka.ms/mdi/sizingtool) on your DCs to collect performance counters for 24 hours‚Äîit spits out an Excel with recommendations.  
- **Sensor Requirements:**  
  - **CPU:** Minimum 2 cores (no hyper-threading).  
  - **RAM & Disk:** At least 10 GB free disk for MDI + OS, plus crash dumps‚Äî100 GB total is a safe bet.  
  - **Throughput:** Supports up to 100,000 packets/sec on each sensor.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Switch to the **High Performance** power plan‚ÄîMDI can be CPU-heavy.  
- Run the sizing tool regularly, especially after major changes (new DCs, heavy AD traffic).  
- Avoid hyper-threading and dynamic memory (ballooning)‚Äîkeep resource allocation predictable.  
- Plan your first sensor in the main site for health checks before branch rollout.  
- Ensure logs can be purged and test connectivity to the Defender portal and your SIEM.
