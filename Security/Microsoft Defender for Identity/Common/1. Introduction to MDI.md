# Introduction to Microsoft Defender for Identity
üóìÔ∏è Published: 2025-07-13

Hello Active Directory guys! 
Your AD forest is the heartbeat of your network‚Äîdomain controllers, trusts, users, groups, GPOs‚Äîall working in harmony. But if an attacker sneaks in, they can eavesdrop on LDAP/Kerberos traffic, steal tickets, and move laterally until they own your entire domain. **Microsoft Defender for Identity** is the AD-focused sentinel built to spot and stop those moves in real time.

## Sobering Stats

- **\$3.5 million**: average cost of a data breach.  
- **80+ days**: how long attackers lurk before detection.  
- **75 %** of breaches start with stolen credentials.  
- **\$500 billion**: projected global cybercrime cost this year.

You‚Äôd never leave your domain controllers unguarded‚Äîlet‚Äôs see how Defender for Identity shields them.

## What Is Microsoft Defender for Identity?

A cloud-powered solution that:

- **Monitors on-premises AD** by installing lightweight sensors on your Domain Controllers, AD FS and AD CS servers.  
- **Streams only metadata** (events & parsed traffic) to the Azure cloud for analysis‚Äîno raw logs leave your network.  
- **Leverages the Intelligent Security Graph** & machine learning to pinpoint anomalies and known attack patterns.  
- **Integrates with Microsoft Defender XDR**, unifying signals from endpoints, apps, email, and identities for a single pane of glass.

## Core Components & Architecture

1. **Defender for Identity Sensors**  
   - Installed directly on **Domain Controllers** (including RODCs), **AD FS** and **AD CS** servers.  
   - Capture Windows events (ETW, Security log) and parse LDAP, Kerberos, NTLM network traffic locally.  
   - One sensor per domain acts as the **Domain Synchronizer**, syncing AD entities proactively.  
   - Sensors throttle themselves to leave ‚â• 15 % CPU & memory free on the host.

2. **Defender for Identity Cloud Service**  
   - Runs in Azure regions worldwide; connected to the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph.  
   - Performs behavioral analytics, real-time detections, and stores attack timelines.

3. **Microsoft Defender Portal**  
   - Your central console to create & configure workspaces, view alerts, investigate incidents, and trigger automated responses.  
   - Can forward alerts to SIEMs or Microsoft Sentinel, and send email notifications for health issues & security alerts.

## Prerequisites & Licensing

- **Operating Systems**: Windows Server 2016, 2019, 2022 (fully patched).  
- **Accounts**:  
  - A **Group Managed Service Account (gMSA)** or Directory Service account with **read** access to your AD.  
  - For AD FS/AD CS/Microsoft Entra Connect servers, the sensor must run under a gMSA (cannot use LocalService).  
- **Network**:  
  - **TCP 443** outbound from each sensor to the Defender for Identity cloud service.  
  - Standard Windows protocols (RPC, NetBIOS, RDP) within the LAN to query AD objects for lateral movement detection.  
- **Licenses** (one of):  
  - Enterprise Mobility + Security E5/A5  
  - Microsoft 365 E5/A5/G5  
  - Microsoft 365 E5/A5/G5/F5 Security  
  - Microsoft 365 F5 Security + Compliance  
  - Standalone Defender for Identity license

## Key Features

- **Behavioral Analytics**  
  Learns ‚Äúnormal‚Äù AD user & machine behavior, then flags anomalies (odd authentication times, unusual LDAP queries, etc.).  
- **Built-in Detections**  
  Pre-tuned for Pass-the-Hash, Kerberoasting, Golden Ticket, DCShadow, and other AD-centric attacks.  
- **Attack Timeline**  
  A chronological, storyboard-style view of every action an attacker took‚Äîfrom initial reconnaissance to domain dominance.  
- **Automated Response**  
  Block or quarantine compromised accounts, force password resets, or isolate machines automatically.  
- **SIEM & Sentinel Integration**  
  Forward rich alerts and raw signals to your existing SIEM or into Microsoft Sentinel for deeper correlation.

## Why Identity Is the New Perimeter

1. **Stealthy Reconnaissance**: LDAP and Kerberos make stealth scanning trivial.  
2. **Credential Theft**: Stolen tickets let attackers impersonate any user.  
3. **Lateral Movement**: Legitimate protocols (SMB, RPC) hide malicious traffic.  
4. **Domain Takeover**: One Golden Ticket or DCShadow attack can give full control.

Defender for Identity sits right inside your AD fabric, watching every identity‚Äêrelated event so you can catch threats **before** they become breaches.
