## Delegate Access to Audit logs that include XDR change configuration  

The unified audit logs in Microsoft Purview record configuration changes across your tenant, including who did what in the Defender XDR portal.
Delegate access to these logs to enable auditors or analysts to track XDR config changes without granting broader admin rights.

2 Permissions:

- **View‚ÄëOnly Audit Logs**  
  - Read‚Äëonly access to all audit events (who, what, when).  
  - Ideal for stakeholders who only need to review activity.

- **Audit Logs**  
  - Read and export audit events.  
  - Recommended for people that need to archive or analyze logs offline.

> Both roles cover the entire tenant‚Äôs audit data, so delegates will see all audit events by default‚ÄØ‚Äî‚ÄØincluding but not limited to XDR configuration changes.

### Steps to Configure Audit Roles Delegation in Purview

- Create a custom role in Purview
