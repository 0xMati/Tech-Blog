# 🔄 Automatic Password Rotation for SCRIL Accounts in Active Directory
🗓️ Published: 2025-05-13

## 🔹 Introduction

In Active Directory, enabling the setting **Smart Card is Required for Interactive Logon (SCRIL)** enforces strong authentication by preventing users from signing in using a password. When this flag is set, the user's password is replaced with a random, unknown value, effectively eliminating password-based access.

However, by default, this password **never expires**, which creates a **security risk**: the associated NTLM hash remains valid indefinitely and can be exploited in pass-the-hash attacks.

Starting with **Windows Server 2016**, a domain-level feature introduces **automatic rotation of passwords** for SCRIL-enabled accounts. This ensures that NTLM hashes are regularly replaced — improving security posture without requiring manual intervention or scripts.

This article explains the prerequisites, how the mechanism works, how to test it in a lab (even without a physical smart card), and best practices to adopt in production environments.

## ✅ Prerequisites

To enable automatic password rotation for SCRIL (Smart Card is Required for Interactive Logon) accounts, the following conditions must be met in the Active Directory environment:

**Forest Functional Level = Windows Server 2016 or higher**
 Required for the domain controller to support this feature.

**`msDS-ExpirePasswordsOnSmartCardOnlyAccounts = TRUE`**
Enables password rotation at the domain level.
This is a domain attribute introduced in Windows Server 2016.

**`SmartcardRequired = TRUE` on the user account**
This enables the SCRIL flag.
It can be set using Active Directory Users and Computers or PowerShell.

**`PasswordNeverExpires = FALSE`**
The user account must allow password expiration. 
If set to TRUE, the rotation mechanism is bypassed.

**A valid `pwdLastSet` value**
A password must exist on the account. If not, expiration and rotation will not trigger.

**Password expiration policy applied** (via GPO or FGPP)
The domain or Fine-Grained Password Policy must define a `maxPwdAge` greater than zero.

## 🔁 Password Rotation Logic

When all prerequisites are met, Active Directory can automatically rotate the password of a SCRIL-enabled account. This process ensures that NTLM secrets are periodically updated without manual intervention.

### Password Rotation Happens at Logon
The domain controller **only evaluates expiration during user logon**. If the password is expired:
- A new secure random password is generated automatically with a random 128-bit value.
- The `pwdLastSet` attribute is updated.
- The NTLM hash changes, reducing the risk of hash reuse attacks.

⚠️ Rotation **does not happen in the background** — only when a user logs on **and** the password is expired.

### Rotation is Invisible to the User
Since SCRIL users never interact with their password:
- No prompt is shown.
- No user action is needed.
- The operation is transparent and secure.

## ⚠️ Warnings & Recommendations

- 🔁 **Password rotation only occurs at logon** and **only if the password is expired**.
- ❌ Avoid setting `PasswordNeverExpires = TRUE` — this will block expiration and thus prevent rotation.
- 🔐 Ensure accounts have a valid `pwdLastSet` value — if missing or set to `0`, password expiration won’t trigger.
- 🧪 Use a test account and FGPP with short expiration (e.g. 5 minutes) to verify the behavior in lab.
- ⚙️ Prefer gradual rollout using Fine-Grained Password Policies (FGPP) for controlled deployment.
- 🛡️ Be cautious with VPN scenarios: if users log on with cached credentials and the password changes in AD, it may cause lockouts.
- 🔍 Monitor `pwdLastSet` and authentication logs to confirm rotation is working as expected.

- Does this work with service accounts? → ❌ No, it’s meant for interactive logon users only.
- Can the rotation be scheduled or forced? → ❌ No, only evaluated at logon.
- Does it work in hybrid environments with Entra ID? → ⚠️ Not fully; see known limitations.

- 🧰 Use tools such as PtHTools by NSA Cybersecurity to detect accounts that haven’t had their NTLM secrets rotated and assess pass-the-hash exposure:
