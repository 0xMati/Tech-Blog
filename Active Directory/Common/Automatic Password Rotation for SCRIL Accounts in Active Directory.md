# üîÑ Automatic Password Rotation for SCRIL Accounts in Active Directory
üóìÔ∏è Published: 2025-05-13

## üîπ Introduction

In Active Directory, enabling the setting **Smart Card is Required for Interactive Logon (SCRIL)** enforces strong authentication by preventing users from signing in using a password. When this flag is set, the user's password is replaced with a random, unknown value, effectively eliminating password-based access.

However, by default, this password **never expires**, which creates a **security risk**: the associated NTLM hash remains valid indefinitely and can be exploited in pass-the-hash attacks.

Starting with **Windows Server 2016**, a domain-level feature introduces **automatic rotation of passwords** for SCRIL-enabled accounts. This ensures that NTLM hashes are regularly replaced ‚Äî improving security posture without requiring manual intervention or scripts.

This article explains the prerequisites, how the mechanism works, how to test it in a lab (even without a physical smart card), and best practices to adopt in production environments.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

To enable automatic password rotation for SCRIL (Smart Card is Required for Interactive Logon) accounts, the following conditions must be met in the Active Directory environment:

**Forest Functional Level = Windows Server 2016 or higher**
 Required for the domain controller to support this feature.

**`msDS-ExpirePasswordsOnSmartCardOnlyAccounts = TRUE`**
Enables password rotation at the domain level.
This is a domain attribute introduced in Windows Server 2016.

**`SmartcardRequired = TRUE` on the user account**
This enables the SCRIL flag.
It can be set using Active Directory Users and Computers or PowerShell.

**`PasswordNeverExpires = FALSE`**
The user account must allow password expiration. 
If set to TRUE, the rotation mechanism is bypassed.

**A valid `pwdLastSet` value**
A password must exist on the account. If not, expiration and rotation will not trigger.

**Password expiration policy applied** (via GPO or FGPP)
The domain or Fine-Grained Password Policy must define a `maxPwdAge` greater than zero.

## üîÅ Password Rotation Logic

When all prerequisites are met, Active Directory can automatically rotate the password of a SCRIL-enabled account. This process ensures that NTLM secrets are periodically updated without manual intervention.

### Password Rotation Happens at Logon
The domain controller **only evaluates expiration during user logon**. If the password is expired:
- A new secure random password is generated automatically with a random 128-bit value.
- The `pwdLastSet` attribute is updated.
- The NTLM hash changes, reducing the risk of hash reuse attacks.

‚ö†Ô∏è Rotation **does not happen in the background** ‚Äî only when a user logs on **and** the password is expired.

### Rotation is Invisible to the User
Since SCRIL users never interact with their password:
- No prompt is shown.
- No user action is needed.
- The operation is transparent and secure.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings & Recommendations

- üîÅ **Password rotation only occurs at logon** and **only if the password is expired**.
- ‚ùå Avoid setting `PasswordNeverExpires = TRUE` ‚Äî this will block expiration and thus prevent rotation.
- üîê Ensure accounts have a valid `pwdLastSet` value ‚Äî if missing or set to `0`, password expiration won‚Äôt trigger.
- üß™ Use a test account and FGPP with short expiration (e.g. 5 minutes) to verify the behavior in lab.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Prefer gradual rollout using Fine-Grained Password Policies (FGPP) for controlled deployment.
- üõ°Ô∏è Be cautious with VPN scenarios: if users log on with cached credentials and the password changes in AD, it may cause lockouts.
- üîç Monitor `pwdLastSet` and authentication logs to confirm rotation is working as expected.

- Does this work with service accounts? ‚Üí ‚ùå No, it‚Äôs meant for interactive logon users only.
- Can the rotation be scheduled or forced? ‚Üí ‚ùå No, only evaluated at logon.
- Does it work in hybrid environments with Entra ID? ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Not fully; see known limitations.

- üß∞ Use tools such as PtHTools by NSA Cybersecurity to detect accounts that haven‚Äôt had their NTLM secrets rotated and assess pass-the-hash exposure:
