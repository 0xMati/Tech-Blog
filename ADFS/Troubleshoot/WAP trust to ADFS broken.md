> **Quickie**  
> Your ADFS Proxy‚Äôs short-lived cert kicked the bucket. Now it‚Äôs ghosting your ADFS server. Let‚Äôs bring it back from the dead‚ÄîGUI or PowerShell, your call.

## What Happened?

In my lab playground, I let the WAP‚Äôs auth cert expire. Ooops. The proxy and the Federation Service stopped chatting‚Äîinternal ADFS was fine, but the proxy might as well have been on Mars.

### Symptoms

- **Remote Access Console** throws `0x8007520C`.

- **Event ID 422** on the proxy:  
  ```
  401 Unauthorized fetching proxy config.
  ```

- **Event ID 394** on ADFS:  
  > ‚ÄúProxy trust certificate ‚Ä¶ has expired.‚Äù

## Fix #1: Old-School GUI

1. **Reg tweak**  
   ```
   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\ADFS\ProxyConfigurationStatus
   ```
   Flip the DWORD from `2` ‚Üí `1`.

2. **Re-open** Remote Access Management (no reboot dance).

3. **Run the wizard** again:  
   - Federation Service name: `adfs.tailspintoys.ca` (or yours).  
   - Pick the right SSL cert (thumbprint check!).  
   - Click through the screens‚Äîpeek at the PowerShell if you‚Äôre curious.

4. **Restart ADFS** on the proxy:
   ```powershell
   Restart-Service adfssrv
   ```

Boom. Trust is back in business.

## Fix #2: PowerShell Magic

For CLI aficionados:

```powershell
$thumb = "YOUR_CERT_THUMBPRINT"
$fsn   = "adfs.tailspintoys.ca"

Install-WebApplicationProxy `
  -CertificateThumbprint $thumb `
  -FederationServiceName $fsn
```

Enter your ADFS admin creds when prompted, wait a sec‚Ä¶ **Deployment Succeeded!**

## Did It Work?

- **Proxy logs**: Event ID 245 ‚Üí ‚ÄúConfig retrieved, all good.‚Äù  
- **ADFS logs**: Event ID 396 ‚Üí ‚ÄúTrust renewed, party on!‚Äù

Users can now auth from the Internet again. üéâ
